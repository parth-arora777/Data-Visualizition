Project Title:
Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard

Description:
The Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard is an interactive tool designed to provide deep insights into customer behavior and identify key factors driving customer churn. By leveraging comprehensive customer metrics, billing details, and subscription patterns, this dashboard empowers data-driven decision-making aimed at reducing churn rates and enhancing customer retention strategies.

Key Questions Addressed:
How many customers have churned?

What are the monthly and yearly charges for customers?

What percentage of customers adopt paperless billing?

What are the most common payment methods?

What is the distribution of subscription periods among customers?

What are the demographics of the customer base (e.g., dependents, senior citizens, partners, gender distribution)?

What is the distribution of contract types among customers?

Which additional services do customers frequently adopt?
